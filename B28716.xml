            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reasons for the continuance of the common Assurance of Land by Fines.</head>
            <p n="1">I. Fines are the common and the most ancient Assurances of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long before the Conquest: <hi>Plow. fol. 357. &amp; 368.</hi> which puts an end to all Controversies in the Law, and against which there is no averment.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They are the most short and concise of all Evidences, yet full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in so much that the <hi>Chirographer</hi> (for security) writes them twice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to be kept in severall places; proclaims them foure times in open Court; And because all parties are by them barred, not claiming within five years, He enters them in severall Rolls, every County by it self, to be sent into each perticular County, and published at the Assizes, and all this for his Fee of five shillings, <hi>per Stat. 13 E. 1. 4 Hen. 7.23. Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. They are most in esteeme and acceptation with the people, against which there was never any complaint: And in case the State should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish their Revenue thereby (which none complains against) amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to twenty thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> at least) they would be as cheap Assurances, and as perfect Evidences as can be devised.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They are by the wisdom of former Parliaments so carefully provided for, in way of their acknowledgment, prosecution, and recording, as that they can neither be forged nor embezeled.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Although divers persons inhabiting in severall Counties should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to have one joynt estate in Lands, which lye in many Counties, yet may they all joyne and leavy a Fine by Commission, and so passe away their Estates at their own severall habitations, without further travell or trouble.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. They bar a Feme Covert, which no other Deed or Conveyance can do.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. They may (as anciently usually they did) with much brevity declare their own uses, that the parties need no other deed.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, seeing Fines are so concise, so ancient, so cheap; so much esteemed by all men, such perfect Assurances, and in regard they put an end to all Suits, bar all Claims, have so many Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament approving and strengthning them, and take their rise long before the comming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and are part of the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi> It is humbly conceived, it will be most safe and acceptable to the people still to hold their Estates by this Assurance.</p>
